 ##	Chatter

In this age of pictures, hashtags, Reels and Tiktoks, likes and comments, a traditional bookworm’s heaven would be a blog to get access to more text-based content. Chatter aims to be that heaven specifically for this kind of audience. A multi-functional platform where authors and readers can create and have access to their own content. Chatter aims to knock off competition from the likes of Hashnode and Medium in its first 2 years of launch.
